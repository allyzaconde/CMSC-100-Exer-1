			How is your Holiday/Semestral Break? 
			It was relaxing and slow, I was able to spend a lot of time with family and friends just hanging out, going to Manila for family reunions during the holidays, being able to have more time in practicing violin for our Church Orchestra and generally being able to do my hobbies.<br>

			How is your experience with the recent Taal Volcano eruption?
			Our house was fairly near the eruption, we first found out about it when we saw a strange, tall, gray, cloud-like object in the sky which was spreading pretty quickly, and then in a few minutes, ash was falling down from the sky covering our entire village with ash. It was very dangerous for the whole week to even go out because of all the ash. After the ashfall was almost done, we got our roof cleaned up and collected more than 5 sacks of ash.<br>
